### Image uploading

You can more easily and faster upload new images by drag and dropping it over the element selection menu. This automatically fills the upload modal fields and if your image name is proper, all you have to do is press upload!

### Copy pasting on the canvas

You can copy paste images or text directly on to the canvas, without the need to upload them first.
